# Base Layer

## Description

The `base` layer is the foundational layer of the Nuxt application. It contains the core configuration, global styles, essential components, and utilities that are shared across all other layers.

Its main purpose is to establish a consistent structure and provide common functionalities that the rest of the application will build upon.

## Key Components

- `app/`
  - `components/`: Global and reusable Vue components (e.g., headers, footers, navigation bars).
  - `layouts/`: Default application layouts.
  - `pages/`: The main pages of the application, such as the home page (`index.vue`).

- `nuxt.config.ts`: The primary Nuxt configuration file for this layer. It defines UI settings (like Nuxt UI Pro), global styles, and other essential configurations.

## Configuration

This layer is configured to be extended by other layers. It sets up global dependencies like `@nuxt/ui-pro` and defines the main application structure. Any configuration defined here will be inherited and can be overridden by more specific layers (`auth`, `chat`, `marketing`).
